ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMER:

This software was created entirely through AI-assisted "vibe coding" - a process
where all code was generated through natural language conversation with AI models.
As such, the code may contain unconventional patterns, inefficiencies, or bugs
that would not typically appear in human-written code. Users are encouraged to
review, test, and improve the code as needed.

The AI-generated nature of this code does not affect the license terms above,
but users should be aware of its origin when evaluating its suitability for
their purposes.
